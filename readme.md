<h1>Overview</h1>
Inspired by Microsoft's Metro Design Language, I was in need of a metro-styled CSS3 button library. I wanted to make similar metro-looking buttons used by Microsoft (extensively used in their Microsoft Windows Azure website) So I've built a very small, simple and clean CSS3 library to deal with my problem.

My goal is to help developers out there shave off some wasted time building that metro-like stylesheet by providing them a library, a starter kit, a base on which they can build upon.

 <h1>Developers</h1>
<h3>LESS</h3>
LESS makes us write CSS much more like functional programming and it trains us to solve problems that way. I use wearekiss's  <a href="wearekiss.com/simpless">SIMPLESS</a>. To know more about LESS visit http://www.lesscss.org.
